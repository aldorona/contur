This respository contains the CONTUR code in 
Appendix D of J.C. Sivells, A computer program for the aerodynamic
design of axisymmetric and planar nozzles for supersonic and hypersonic
wind tunnels, ARO Inc., a Sverdrup Corporation Company, ADEC TR 78 63,
December 1978.

The code uses a combination of analytical solutions, the method of 
characteristics, and centerline distributions in order to calculate the
divergent section of a convergent-divergent de Laval nozzle.
 
This is a FORTRAN 77 code which runs through a series of 16 subroutines 
and uses 7 user-defined input cards describing the flow conditions of 
the desired nozzle profile.

Sivells reports the input cards and output file of a MACH 4 
axisymmetric nozzle. The version of the code in this repository was
run in May 2019 on this test case and the same output was obtained.

The "JD" parameter allows for the direct control of the nozzle geometry.
By changing the JD parameter and the BMACH parameter in the proposed 
input file (JD=-1 and BMACH=3.2), a planar nozzle contour will be 
obtained. BMACH represents the Mach number at point B, which is the 
point at which the downstream method of characteristics solution is 
initiated. It is recommended to keep the Mach number at this point equal
to 80% of the design Mach number (CMC parameter).
 
The author, Florentina-Luiza Zavalan, under the guide of project
supervisor Aldo Rona, typeset Appendix D from the freely available
source code listing at 
https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a062944.pdf
Significant effort was put in to interpret the low-resolution scan and
to disambigue similar typographical symbols (e.g. * from +).

If you find any bug while testing, please report it to the authors:

computer program by J.C. Sivells".

Code instructions:
1. Create a new directory, suggested name: sivells
2. Download in the SAME directory the bundle of 20 *.f source files,
one input.txt file, makefile.
3. You are advised to also download Sivells.pdf, which is article by
Sivells, data.txt, which is the sample output from the MACH 4 test case.
4. Compile the code by just typing: make. This will create the object
 files *.o and the executable MAIN.exe
5. Run the executably MAIN.exe

Frequently Asked Questions
1. You may need to let makefile know what compiler you are using. To
do so, use a text editor to edit makefile and change FC=ifort to your
own compiler, e.g. gfort. Run the command "man -k fortran" to find out
what compiler is installed on your system.

2. You may need to change the compiler flags according to what is
available from your compiler. In unix/linux, you can typeset
"man mycompiler" to find out what flags are available.

Successfully tested code for 2D nozzle design, added a sample input file
for 2D design. To run the 2D nozzle design, mv input2d.txt input.txt and
then run the code.
